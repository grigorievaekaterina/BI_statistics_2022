# Homework 1

## Description

This is the first homework for the course. Tasks cover basic statistics and hypothesis testing and can be found in the notebook. 

The .py file is the program which accepts the following arguments as input:

`first_cell_type_expressions_path` – the path to the table with gene expressions for one cell type; 
`second_cell_type_expressions_path` – the path to the table with gene expressions for the second cell type. 

The program returns `save_results_table` – the table with ci-test results and z-test results.

### P.S. Before running do not forget to install packages from requirements.txt:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
